              <b>Local Storage:</b> <br />
              This read-only interface property provides access to the
              Document's local storage object, the stored data is stored across
              browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that
              localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends - that
              is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private”
              tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document
              loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).
            </p>

            <p class="border-add">
              <b>Session Storage:</b> <br />
              Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage
              read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and
              localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
              sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

              <b>The Global scope:</b> <br />
              A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is
              declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in
              the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line
              of code in the program, including inside blocks.
            </p>

            <p class="border-add">
              <b>The Block scope:</b> <br />
              So far, we've seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can
              declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The
              variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable
              to local ones. They are available within the block that they are
              defined.

            03. How does the JavaScript event loop work?
          </h2>
          <div class="margin-field">
            <p class="border-add" style="width: 100%">
              <b>Event Loop:</b> <br />We'll start with a somewhat of an odd
              claim — despite allowing async JavaScript code (like the
              setTimeout we just discussed), until ES6, JavaScript itself has
              actually never had any direct notion of asynchronicity built into
              it. The JavaScript engine has never done anything more than
              executing a single chunk of your program at any given moment.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and
              the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop
              will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the
              Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called
              a tick in the Event Loop.

            04. How many ways to find undefined in JavaScript?
          </h2>
          <div>
            <p class="border-add" style="width: 100%">
              <b>Find undefined:</b> <br />In JavaScript and TypeScript there are
              different methods for checking whether a variable is undefined.
              However, some methods are better than others. After reading this,
              you will never check undefined in the same way again!
              <br />
              variable === undefined The first solution, which is also the more
              used, compare directly the variable value with the built-in global
              identifier undefined which is worthing the value undefined.
              <br />
              typeof variable === 'undefined' The second solution is to use the
              typeof operator. Widely used, it's only cons is its verbosity — 18
              characters. <br />
              variable === void 0 The third and last solution is to use the void
              operator. Used along 0, it allows to perform the check using 6
              characters only without no other cons that having to be known.
